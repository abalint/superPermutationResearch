# Sweep queue — the operator/researcher interface

The RESEARCH agent appends entries (template below). The OPERATOR
executes them top-down, fills in status/results, and never edits the
spec of a pending entry. Andrew's go-ahead is per-entry (`approved:`),
required for anything projected > 30 min. One `running` entry at a time.

Entry template:

```
## <short name>
- spec: <exact command, from repo root>
- product: <what the run proves/produces>
- projected: <runtime estimate and how it was obtained>
- approved: NO | YES (Andrew, <date>)
- status: pending | probing | running (pid, started) | done | aborted
- result: <verbatim summary line + verdict>
```

## anchor-450 sweep (block-order-optimality frontier, third band)
- spec: `cargo run --release --quiet -- tail-atsp -n 6 --dirs data/upstream872 --anchor 450 --max-blocks 50 --quiet --out-dir data/surgery_finds`
- product: extends the s28b law ("every known 872 is block-order-optimal")
  to ~270-perm tails, or finds an 871 candidate (exit 2 → alarm path).
- projected: ~3.5 h (50-walk probe at 0.6 s/walk, s28b; ×1.5 safety ≈ 5 h)
- approved: NO — was launched s28b and aborted at Andrew's request;
  re-launch only on his fresh go-ahead.
- status: pending
- result: —

## tie-census probe (are allocation shells S1-connected?)
- spec: `cargo run --release --quiet -- tail-atsp -n 6 --dirs data/upstream872 --anchor 585 --ties --tie-cap 256 --limit 100 --quiet`
- product: rate measurement for the full tie census + first sample of
  new-allocation tie frequency. (Ties = equal-cost reorderings; those
  landing in a different L0 allocation measure how connected the
  allocation shells are under S1 alone — does (144,4) or any ip=1
  target EVER appear?)
- projected: unmeasured; tie collection weakens B&B pruning (strict-only)
  so this may be much slower than the plain sweep — that is what the
  probe measures. Abort the probe itself if it passes 15 min.
- approved: NO (probe is < 30 min tier, but Andrew declined the first
  launch attempt s28b — confirm with him before running anything here).
- status: pending
- result: —

## tie-census full corpus
- spec: as probe, without `--limit`, `--out-dir data/surgery_finds`
- product: corpus-wide new-allocation tie count + reached-allocation
  histogram (S1 shell-connectivity map; SURGERY-DESIGN §8 next-step).
- projected: probe × 220 — fill in after the probe.
- approved: NO
- status: pending (blocked by probe)
- result: —
