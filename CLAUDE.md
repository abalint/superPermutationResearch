# CLAUDE.md — working conventions for this repo

## What this is

Research codebase hunting for short superpermutations via heuristic search, with a
planned learned value function. **Read `docs/JOURNAL.md` first** — it is the session
handoff log. `docs/THEORY.md` has the math framing; `docs/ROADMAP.md` the phase plan.

## Commands

```bash
cargo test --release                 # acceptance tests are pinned to proven optima (9/33/153)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt
cargo run --release -- greedy -n 5
cargo run --release -- beam -n 5 --width 2000
cargo run --release -- rollouts -n 5 --count 200 --epsilon 0.15 --seed 0 --out out.jsonl
cargo run --release -- validate -n 5 <string>
```

Always benchmark and search in `--release`; debug builds are ~50× slower in the hot loop.

## Hard invariants — do not break

- Greedy with min-weight + lexicographic tie-break MUST produce 9, 33, 153 for n=3,4,5.
  If a graph/ordering refactor changes these numbers, the refactor is wrong.
- The lower bound must stay **admissible** (never exceed true remaining cost) — beam
  pruning correctness and any future branch-and-bound depend on it.
- Every produced string must pass the validator before being reported as a result.
- Rollout JSONL schema changes must be backward compatible or version-bumped — trained
  models depend on it.

## Conventions

- Symbols are `1..=n` as u8, rendered as ASCII digits.
- Ranks are lexicographic (Lehmer). Cycle = weight-1 rotation class, `(n−1)!` of them.
- New search features must be maintainable incrementally (O(1) or O(n) per expansion) —
  anything O(n!) per node is a non-starter at n ≥ 6.
- Every working session ends by appending a dated entry to `docs/JOURNAL.md` and, if
  results changed, updating the README results table.

## Session workflow for AI agents

1. Read `docs/JOURNAL.md` (latest entry) → know where we left off.
2. Do the work; keep `cargo test --release` green.
3. Update JOURNAL.md (+ README results if applicable), commit with a descriptive message.
